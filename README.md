# Churn-Analysis-PowerBI-

## In this project, I have applied my Power BI skills to analyze a real-world dataset from Databel, a telecom company. The focus of the analysis is on customer churn, a critical challenge for subscription-based businesses. The project aims not only to determine the churn rate but also to uncover the underlying reasons behind customer churn and identify strategies to reduce it. I have developed insightful and visually engaging report pages that provide actionable insights into reducing churn for Databel.
